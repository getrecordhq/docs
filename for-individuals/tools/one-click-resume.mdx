### **Introduction:**

The One-Click Resume tool allows you to generate a professional, ATS-friendly resume using the information provided in your **Record profile**. The tool will automatically populate your resume with key details such as **work experience**, **education**, **projects**, **skills**, **licenses**, **certifications**, and **other activities**. You can select relevant skills from the list and download your resume in either **ATS-friendly format** or **Visually Appealing format**.

### **Steps to Generate Your Personalized Resume:**

1. **Select Relevant Skills:**
   - Choose from the **skills** available in the system based on the role you're applying for. Skills like **Content Marketing**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Project Management**, etc., are selectable based on your expertise. These skills will be highlighted in your resume.

<Info>
  You can **only select skills** from the pre-defined list. **Unselectable skills** are pre-populated based on your profile and cannot be changed.

2. **Automatic Population of Resume Sections:**
   - Once you select the relevant skills, the tool will automatically populate the following sections of your resume:
     - **Projects**: Highlights key projects listed on your profile.
     - **Work Experience**: Automatically pulled from the work experience section of your profile.
     - **Education**: Pulled directly from the education section.
     - **Licenses & Certifications**: Any verified certifications or licenses from your profile.
     - **Other Activities**: Includes extra-curricular activities, volunteering, or other notable activities.
3. **Customizing Your Resume (Profile Edit):**
   - **Profile-Linked Edits**: All the content in your resume is drawn from your **Record profile**. To change the content of your resume, you need to update the corresponding section in your profile (e.g., update your work experience or skills directly in your profile).
   - **Non-Editable Skills**: Skills are **non-editable** in the resume template. You can only select relevant ones for each job role. The resume automatically reflects those changes based on your profile data.
   - If you want to **modify the content** of any section (e.g., description of work experience or education), you need to **edit your profile** first.
4. **Choose a Resume Template:**
   - Once all sections are populated from your profile, you can choose one of the following templates:
     - **ATS-Friendly Resume**: Optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). This is best for applying to most jobs in traditional industries.
     - **Visual Resume**: Best for creative roles, this format allows you to highlight your design skills and creative portfolio.
5. **Download or Share Your Resume:**
   - After finalizing your resume, you can download it in PDF format.
   - Alternatively, you can **share** your resume link directly with recruiters or via social media platforms.

### **How Your Profile Affects the Resume Generation:**

- **Skills Selection**: The skills you select in the tool directly correspond to the skills listed in your profile. However, only **selectable skills** from the pre-defined list will appear on the resume.
- **Profile Data Impact**: Your profile data (e.g., work experience, projects, education) is what generates your resume content. Ensure your profile is up-to-date for the most accurate resume generation.
- **Verification**: If your profile contains any **verified credentials or certifications**, they will be included in your resume and marked as verified.

### **Key Features of the Resume Tool:**

- **ATS-Friendly Resume**: The **ATS Resume** is designed to ensure it passes through Applicant Tracking Systems, which are commonly used by companies to filter resumes.
- **Customizable Templates**: While the content is based on your profile, you can select between the **ATS-Friendly** and **Visual Resume** templates.
- **No Need to Manually Input Data**: The One-Click Resume tool pulls your data directly from your **Record profile**, saving you time and effort.
- **Download and Share**: Once your resume is ready, you can download it as a **PDF** or share it with recruiters.

### **Troubleshooting:**

- **Missing Information**: Ensure that your profile is completely filled out. If some sections are empty (e.g., missing work experience or skills), these will not appear in the resume.
- **Template Issues**: If the template is not showing as expected, check for any missing or incorrect information in your profile.
- **Customizing Beyond Profile**: If you need further customization to your resume beyond what's offered by the tool, update your profile information first, then regenerate the resume.

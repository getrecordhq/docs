### **Introduction:**

The YouTube to Course tool enables you to convert educational YouTube videos or entire playlists into structured courses. This feature is designed for users who want to organize their YouTube learning experience, track progress, take notes, and earn certificates and skills.

### **Steps for Converting any Educational YouTube Playlist/Video into a Course:**

1. **Copy the YouTube Video/Playlist Link:** Go to YouTube and open the video or playlist you want to convert into a course. Click on the **Share** button beneath the video and copy the URL or link to the playlist.

   Example:
   - For a single video: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234`
   - For a playlist: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLabcd1234`


2. **Paste the Link into Record:** Navigate to the **YouTube to Course** page on Record. Paste the copied YouTube link into the provided field on the page. Click **Convert**.
3. **The Course is Created:** Once the video or playlist is converted, it will appear in your **My Learnings** section under a new course. The course will be automatically organized based on the videos in the playlist.
4. **Take Notes:** While watching the video, you can take notes. These notes will be saved along with the course, so you can refer back to them later. Notes will be timestamped for easy referencing.

### **Tracking Your Learning Progress:**

1. **Heatmap:** As you progress through the course, your activity will be tracked in the **Learning Activities Heatmap**. This shows the days you were active, helping you stay on track with your learning.
2. **Mark as Completed:** After finishing all the video content, you can mark the course as complete. The system will calculate your progress, and if you’ve completed at least 80% of the content, it will unlock the **Assessment** section.

### **Taking the Assessment:**

1. **What is the Assessment?**

   After **completing 80% of the course**, an **Assessment** will be available to test your knowledge. This assessment consists of multiple questions based on the videos in the course.
2. **How to Take the Assessment:**
   - Go to the **Assessment** section of the course.
   - Answer the questions based on the video content.
   - Once completed, submit your assessment for evaluation.
3. **Passing the Assessment:**
   - If you pass the assessment, you will earn a **Certificate of Completion**. You will also receive a **Skills** related to the course topic, which can be added to your profile and shared with recruiters.
4. **Failure & Retake:**
   - If you fail the assessment, you will have a **24-hour cool-down period** before you can retake the test. After 24 hours, you will be able to take the assessment again.

### **Certificates and Skills:**

1. **Skills:**
   - Upon successfully passing the assessment, you will receive **Skills** that represents your proficiency in the course topic. Those skills will be added to your profile and can be shared with employers or on professional networks.
2. **Certificate of Completion:**
   - In addition to the skills, you will also receive a **Certificate of Completion** for the content - content by the creator, verified by Record. You can download the certificate in PDF format or share it directly on platforms like LinkedIn. So your YouTube self learning have tangible proof.

### **Important Notes:**

- **Educational Content Only:** The tool is designed to convert educational YouTube videos only. Non-educational videos will not be processed or converted into courses.
- **Limitations:** The conversion tool only accepts public YouTube videos and playlists. Private videos or playlists cannot be converted.
- **Video Accessibility:** Ensure the videos are accessible for viewing without restrictions (e.g., age-restricted content may not be supported).

### **Troubleshooting:**

- **No Assessment Available?**
  - If the assessment is not available, ensure that you have completed at least 80% of the course content. Only after reaching 80% will the assessment be unlocked.
- **Error Loading Content:**
  - If you encounter any issues loading the YouTube video or playlist, verify that the URL is correct. If the issue persists, try using a different YouTube link or check the video’s availability.

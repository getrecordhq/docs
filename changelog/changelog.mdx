  ### YouTube to course converter, one-click resume, AI interview, and more…

  ### **YouTube to Course Converter is LIVE (YEAH!)**

  After weeks of wrangling APIs, transcript parsing, and assessment logic, we shipped YEAH -YouTube Educational Assessment Hub.

  You can now turn any educational YouTube video or playlist into a distraction-free, structured course.

  Watch → Take notes → Hit 80% → Unlock assessment → Get certified → Earn skill badges.

  Because your self-learning deserves tangible outcomes.

  ### **One-Click Resume**

  Your profile → Your skills → Instant resume. We now generate:

  Pure ATS-friendly resumes tailored to your skills

  Visually branded Record-style resumes too

  Both are downloadable in one click, no formatting stress required.

  ### **AI Interview (v1)**

  You’ve got skills. But can you speak to them?

  Now, Record lets you take an AI-powered mock interview based on your profile.

  Your best response video is attached to your profile, so recruiters can evaluate you even before Round 1.

  A shortcut to serious shortlisting.

Last Updated: 25 Dec 2025

These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the GoodFreshers platform by recruiters, employers, and recruitment organizations. By creating a recruiter account or using GoodFreshers for Recruiters, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.

## 1. Recruiter Account Eligibility

By creating a recruiter account, you confirm that you represent a legitimate company or recruitment organization and that you are authorized to recruit on behalf of your organization. You agree to use the platform solely for genuine recruitment and hiring purposes. All company information provided must be accurate, complete, and verifiable. You further agree to comply with all applicable employment, labor, and recruitment laws.

## 2. Account Management and Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and ensuring that only authorized recruitment personnel access your account. You must notify GoodFreshers immediately if you suspect unauthorized access or security breaches. All actions performed through your recruiter account, including profile views, candidate outreach, job postings, and hiring decisions, are your responsibility.

You agree to provide accurate company details, verify your official company email address, keep job postings and contact information updated, and inform GoodFreshers of any changes in company ownership, structure, or recruitment authority.

## 3. Finding and Accessing Talent

Recruiters may browse candidate profiles of learners who have explicitly opted into the GoodFreshers talent network. Access to profiles, views, and features is governed by your active subscription plan. Candidate skill badges are issued or verified through educational institutions, collaborators, or assessment mechanisms on the platform.

Candidate profiles may include verified skill badges, educational background, completed courses, work experience if shared by the candidate, portfolio projects, availability status, and job preferences. The completeness of profiles depends on information voluntarily provided by candidates.

Profile viewing limits apply based on your subscription plan. Bulk downloading, copying, scraping, or automated extraction of candidate data is strictly prohibited. Use of bots, scripts, or automated tools is not allowed. API access, if required, is subject to a separate enterprise agreement.

## 4. Contacting Candidates

You agree to contact candidates only for legitimate job opportunities and recruitment-related discussions. All outreach must be professional, respectful, and personalized. You must respect candidate communication preferences and promptly respond to candidate inquiries when engaged.

You must present accurate information regarding job roles, responsibilities, compensation, benefits, work location, and employment type. You must not make false promises, misleading claims, or misrepresent roles. Candidates have the right to decline opportunities, and such decisions must be respected. Candidate information must be treated as confidential at all times.

You must not contact candidates for non-recruitment purposes, repeatedly message candidates who have opted out, request inappropriate personal information, discriminate based on protected characteristics, or engage in harassment or coercive behavior.

## 5. Pricing, Subscription Plans, and Payments

Recruiter pricing is based on the number of candidate profiles viewable, outreach limits, access to advanced search filters, and premium features such as analytics and tracking tools. Subscription fees may be billed monthly or annually, as selected.

Payment must be completed before plan activation. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled prior to renewal. Invoices will be provided electronically for record-keeping. You may upgrade your plan at any time with immediate effect. Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle, and any applicable price differences may be prorated.

Refund requests must be submitted within seven days of purchase and are subject to usage review. Significant usage of candidate data may affect refund eligibility. Annual plans may be prorated after the first month. GoodFreshers reserves the right to update pricing with advance notice. Existing subscriptions will continue at current pricing until renewal.

## 6. Data Usage and Privacy Compliance

You agree to use candidate data strictly for recruitment purposes related to specific job opportunities. You must not sell, share, rent, or distribute candidate data to third parties. Appropriate technical and organizational security measures must be implemented to protect candidate information.

You must not store candidate data in unsecured systems, use candidate data for marketing or solicitation, build competing databases, or transfer candidate information outside your organization without authorization. Candidate data must be retained only for active recruitment purposes and deleted when no longer required, or upon candidate request, subject to applicable laws.

You must notify GoodFreshers immediately if you become aware of any data breach or suspected compromise of candidate information and cooperate fully with investigation and remediation efforts. You may be held liable for breaches resulting from negligence or misuse.

## 7. Professional and Legal Compliance

You agree to comply with all equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and provide fair hiring opportunities to all qualified candidates. Hiring decisions must be based solely on skills, experience, and job fit.

You must comply with employment, labor, visa, salary transparency, and recruitment regulations applicable to your jurisdiction. All representations regarding job roles, compensation, employment terms, and working conditions must be accurate and truthful.

## 8. Acceptable Use Policy

Permitted activities include searching for candidates, contacting qualified applicants, scheduling interviews, tracking recruitment progress, building talent pipelines, and employer branding.

You must not use automated tools, create fake job postings, engage in phishing or scams, impersonate other recruiters or companies, spam candidates, bypass platform restrictions or fees, or use candidate data beyond authorized purposes.

## 9. Account Status, Suspension, and Termination

GoodFreshers may suspend your account if you violate these terms, receive repeated candidate complaints, fail to complete payments beyond the grace period, engage in fraudulent practices, or misuse candidate data.

You may cancel your account at any time through account settings. Access will continue until the end of the billing cycle. No refunds are issued for voluntary mid-cycle cancellations.

GoodFreshers may terminate accounts that repeatedly violate policies, engage in illegal activity, harm candidates or platform integrity, or remain inactive for more than twelve months. Upon termination, access to candidate data is immediately revoked, all downloaded candidate information must be deleted, and outstanding payments must be settled.

## 10. Intellectual Property and Branding

All GoodFreshers platform features, technology, and systems are the property of Record. You are granted a limited, non-transferable license to use the platform in accordance with these terms. You must not copy, modify, or reverse engineer the platform.

You retain ownership of your company branding and grant GoodFreshers permission to display your organization and job postings on the platform and in marketing materials, unless otherwise agreed.

## 11. Disclaimers, Liability, and Indemnification

The platform is provided on an “as is” basis. Candidate information is provided by learners, collaborators, or institutions, and GoodFreshers does not guarantee accuracy or hiring outcomes.

You are solely responsible for candidate evaluation, hiring decisions, background checks, employment offers, and compliance with employment laws. GoodFreshers is not liable for recruitment outcomes or employment relationships.

GoodFreshers's total liability is limited to the fees paid by you in the preceding twelve months and excludes indirect or consequential damages to the fullest extent permitted by law.

You agree to indemnify and hold GoodFreshers harmless from claims arising from your recruitment practices, legal violations, candidate disputes, misuse of data, or platform abuse.

## 12. Feedback and Reporting

Candidates may provide feedback on recruitment experiences. Repeated negative feedback may impact account status. Candidates may report inappropriate communication, fake job postings, discrimination, privacy violations, or scams. All reports are reviewed and may result in account action.

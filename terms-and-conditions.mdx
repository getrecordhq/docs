Last Updated: 25 Dec 2025

These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the GoodFreshers platform by collaborators, including upskilling companies, training institutions, educational organizations, and corporate learning programs. By creating a collaborator account or using the GoodFreshers for Collaborators module, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.

## 1. Collaborator Account Eligibility

By creating a collaborator account, you confirm that you represent a legitimate educational institution, training organization, or corporate learning program and that you are duly authorized to create and manage this account on behalf of your organization. You agree that all information provided about your organization is accurate, current, and verifiable. You further agree to use the platform strictly for genuine educational, training, and skill development purposes.

## 2. Account Management and Security

You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of all administrative credentials associated with your collaborator account. Access to the collaborator dashboard must be restricted to authorized personnel only. You must notify GoodFreshers immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized access or security breach. All actions performed through your collaborator account, including student onboarding, access allocation, assessments, and badge issuance, are your responsibility.

You agree to keep all organization details, billing information, and authorized representative information accurate and up to date and to inform GoodFreshers promptly of any changes.

## 3. Issuing Skill Badges

### 3.1 Badge Integrity and Responsibility

You agree to issue skill badges only to students who have genuinely demonstrated the required skills based on fair and defined evaluation criteria. You must not issue badges fraudulently, in bulk without assessment, or in exchange for payment, incentives, or favorable reviews. You are responsible for maintaining the credibility, integrity, and educational value of all badges issued under your collaborator account.

### 3.2 Assessment Standards

You are solely responsible for designing and conducting assessments that accurately measure student competencies. Assessments must be fair, transparent, and reasonably secure against cheating or misuse. You agree to communicate clear evaluation criteria to students, maintain assessment and evaluation records for a minimum of two years, and provide students the ability to review results and raise genuine disputes or correction requests.

### 3.3 Badge Revocation

You may revoke a skill badge if it was issued based on dishonest, fraudulent, or invalid assessment outcomes. You must provide the affected student with written notice and a clear explanation for the revocation. All revocation actions must be documented and auditable. GoodFreshers reserves the right to review badge revocations if disputes arise.

## 4. Student Access Management

You may provide sponsored access to GoodFreshers features for students based on your active subscription plan. Access duration, features, and limits depend on the selected pricing plan. Student access is activated only after confirmed payment.

Student access remains valid for the duration of the paid subscription period. Students will be notified before access expires. After expiration, students may independently purchase individual subscriptions. Skill badges already earned remain valid regardless of access status.

Your subscription includes a defined number of student seats. Usage may be monitored periodically. Exceeding allocated limits may require plan upgrades, additional fees, or corrective action. Continued overuse without resolution may result in temporary suspension of access.

## 5. Pricing, Billing, and Payments

Collaborator pricing is determined by the number of students, access duration, and selected features. Plans may be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually. Volume discounts and custom enterprise plans may be offered for large cohorts.

Payment must be completed before student access is activated. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date. Invoices will be issued electronically. Failed or delayed payments may result in suspension after a reasonable grace period.

Refunds are considered only within fourteen days of the initial purchase and are subject to usage review. Partial refunds are not available for monthly plans. Refund requests must be submitted to [akshay@goodfreshers.com](mailto:akshay@goodfreshers.com).

GoodFreshers reserves the right to revise pricing with advance notice. Existing subscriptions will continue under original pricing until renewal. You may cancel prior to renewal if revised pricing is unacceptable.

## 6. Content and Course Management

All course materials, assessments, and educational content created by you remain your intellectual property. You grant GoodFreshers a non-exclusive, limited license to host, display, and deliver your content solely for platform operations. You may export your content before account closure. With your consent, GoodFreshers may showcase your courses or organization for marketing purposes.

You are responsible for ensuring that your content is accurate, lawful, up to date, and does not infringe intellectual property or third-party rights. Content must not contain offensive, misleading, or harmful material. GoodFreshers may remove or restrict content that violates these standards.

You may not copy, replicate, reverse engineer, or redistribute GoodFreshers platform tools, features, templates, or workflows outside the platform.

## 7. Student Data and Privacy

You will have access only to student data necessary for delivering your educational programs, including enrollment details, progress tracking, assessment outcomes, badge issuance records, and analytics.

You agree to comply with all applicable data protection and education privacy laws. You must obtain necessary student consent prior to enrollment, use student data solely for legitimate educational purposes, and implement reasonable security measures. You must not sell, misuse, or disclose student data to unauthorized parties.

You must notify GoodFreshers immediately upon discovering any actual or suspected data breach and cooperate fully in investigation and remediation. You may be held liable for breaches resulting from negligence or non-compliance.

## 8. Professional Conduct Standards

You agree to treat all students fairly and without discrimination, provide reasonable student support, maintain professional communication standards, honor commitments made to students, and comply with all applicable education, consumer protection, and employment-related laws.

You must not misrepresent course outcomes, guarantee employment or salaries, issue badges in exchange for incentives, share platform access credentials, or use the platform for non-educational or deceptive purposes.

## 9. Quality Assurance and Monitoring

GoodFreshers may periodically review courses, assessments, badge issuance patterns, and student feedback to maintain platform quality. Repeated complaints or quality concerns may result in audits, corrective actions, suspension of content, or restriction of badge issuance privileges.

## 10. Partnership Duration, Termination, and Suspension

The collaboration begins upon account activation and confirmed payment. Either party may terminate the relationship with thirty days written notice. All outstanding dues must be settled prior to termination.

Upon termination, student access will continue until the end of the paid period. You may export permitted data within thirty days of termination. Skill badges earned by students remain permanently valid.

GoodFreshers may suspend or terminate access immediately in cases of serious violations, fraud, payment defaults, regulatory risks, or actions that harm platform trust or integrity.

## 11. Intellectual Property and Branding

You may display your institution’s branding on your courses and profile, subject to GoodFreshers's branding guidelines. With consent, Record may list your organization as a collaborator or partner.

You may reference goodfreshers.com in marketing materials using approved branding assets. You must not imply exclusive partnerships, endorsements, or guarantees without written agreement.

## 12. Liability, Disclaimers, and Indemnification

The platform is provided on an “as is” basis. GoodFreshers does not guarantee student outcomes, learning results, placements, or assessment accuracy. You remain solely responsible for content quality, assessments, and badge decisions.

GoodFreshers is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. GoodFreshers's total liability is limited to the fees paid by you in the preceding twelve months, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

You agree to indemnify and hold GoodFreshers harmless from claims arising from your content, conduct, student disputes, data breaches caused by your actions, intellectual property violations, or legal non-compliance.
